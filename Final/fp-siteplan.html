            <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
            <p>What are you normal weekend plans? 
                Go out and party or sit at home bored? Just close your eyes and think. 
                You're sitting in your living room alone. It's Friday night and everyone 
                you know is busy you want to stay in and play a game with friends, but alas 
                there is no one to find, so you end up laying down and going to bed early. 
                Cutting what could have been a fun Friday night short. 
                
                Instead imagine a friendly website where you can post a meeting place, 
                time, and a particular game you'd like to play, and nearby people can 
                sign up and you can all meet new people while enjoying classic board games! 
                You get to meet new friends, play a beloved game, and still enjoy a 
                long fun Friday night!
                
                Afraid to meet up in person? That's just fine! We also have options for 
                zoom and discord game nights, and so no matter what you're looking for
                we can find the perfect option for you!
                
                
                Our purpose is to help people find friends in their local neighborhoods to play board games and
                do other activities with.
